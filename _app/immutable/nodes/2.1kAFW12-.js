I received my bachelor’s in computer science in Jordan. Then, I completed my master’s in AI, specifically in natural language processing, and worked as a research assistant in the same area for two years at Jordan University of Science and  Technology.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently a senior research fellow and pursuing my Ph.D. in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) at the Faculty of Science, University of Antwerp, sqIRL/IDLab, imec, Antwerp, Belgium.
                    Additionally, she is a lecturer in the Department of Applied Computer Science at Karel de Grote University of Applied Sciences, Antwerp, Belgium.</p> <p>My research interests include NLP, computer vision, and XAI, with a focus on Capsule Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and text-based analysis.</p> <p>I’m passionate about photography, playing chess, and exploring new places on long walks, which helps me feel more connected to the world around me.
